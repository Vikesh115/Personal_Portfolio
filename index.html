          <h1 class="headings">Website Design</h1>
          <p>
            The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design
            process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website
            including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web
            engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers
            are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role
            involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to
            date with web accessibility guidelines.

          <p>
            User interface (UI) design is the process of making interfaces in
            software or computerized devices with a focus on looks or style.
            Designers aim to create designs users will find easy to use and
            pleasurable. UI design typically refers to graphical user interfaces
            but also includes others, such as voice-controlled ones. User
            experience design draws from design approaches like human-computer
            interaction and user-centered design, and includes elements from
            similar disciplines like interaction design, visual design,
            information architecture, user research, and others.

          <h1 class="headings">Android Development</h1>
          <p>
            Android software development is the process by which applications
            are created for devices running the Android operating system. Google
            states that[3] "Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and
            C++ languages" using the Android software development kit (SDK),
            while using other languages is also possible. All non-JVM languages,
            such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly, need the help of JVM
            language code, that may be supplied by tools, likely with restricted
            API support.
